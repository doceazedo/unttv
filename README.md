> Unlimited read-only access to Twitch API

## Why UNTTV?

Accessing the Twitch API should be fast, easy and straightforward. Helix requires an authentication token, and more often than not, devs just want to build frontend-only apps but suddenly need to have a server to call basic endpoints or expose their tokens on the browser.

UNTTV provides a simplified, cached, and anonymous layer to make the Twitch API more enjoyable!

## How it works?

We use an auto-refreshing token, so you can use this UNTTV from any location. To avoid hitting Twitch's rate limits, we have a limit of **100 requests per minute** per IP.

We also cache results to reduce load on the Twitch API and provide faster responses. By default, results are **cached for 5 minutes** and empty results for 1 minute. Cached responses don't count towards your rate limit. To determine if a response is cached, check for the presence of an `X-Cached` header.

## Who's using it?

- **[emotettv](https://github.com/doceazedo/emotettv):** emote parser that uses UNTTV to load Twitch badges

## API

We implement endpoints as needed, if you need to read a Twitch API endpoint that we don't cover yet, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doceazedo/unttv/issues/new).

Note that UNTTV endpoints don't necessarily match to Twitch's API.
