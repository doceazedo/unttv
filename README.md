> Unlimited read-only access to Twitch API

## Why UNTTV?

Accessing the Twitch API should be fast, easy and straightforward. Helix requires an authentication token, and more often than not, devs just want to build frontend-only apps but suddenly need to have a server to call basic endpoints or expose their tokens on the browser.

UNTTV provides a simplified, cached, and anonymous layer to make the Twitch API more enjoyable!

The name and concept is inspired by [UNGH](https://github.com/unjs/ungh).

## How it works?

We use an auto-refreshing token so you can use this UNTTV anywhere. To prevent getting rate limited by Twitch we â€” ironically â€” have a limit of **50 requests per minute** per IP.

We also cache results on Upstash to avoid beating the Twitch API too much and to provide quick responses. By default, results are **cached for 5 minutes**. Cached responses don't count towards your limit. You can find out if a response is cached by checking if it has a `X-Cached` header.

## Who's using it?

- **[emotettv](https://github.com/doceazedo/emotettv):** emote parser that uses UNTTV to load Twitch badges

## API

We implement endpoints as needed, if you need to read a Twitch API endpoint that we don't cover yet, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doceazedo/unttv/issues/new).

Note that UNTTV endpoints don't necessarily match to Twitch's API.
